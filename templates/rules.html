    <ul>
        <li>Always secure your accounts a few hours after login.</li>
        <li>Accounts cannot be replaced after changing the password.</li>
        <li>We replace bad accounts if the fault is from us (not after use).</li>
        <li>These rules can be changed at any time without prior notice.</li>
        <li>Obscene language to the admins may be grounds for service refusal.</li>
        <li>Ignorance of the rules does not absolve you of responsibility.</li>
        <li>The response time for technical support and the resolution of all problems/claims is 24/7.</li>
        <li>Accounts are always checked by our private program on private mobile proxy prior to sale, so we can guarantee 100% validity of the items.</li>
        <li>Accounts cannot be returned; instead, they can only be replaced if bad, provided that other rules are complied with.</li>
        <li>The store is not liable for any account activity. How your account will last depends on how itâ€™s used. No replacement or refund for an account suspended/disabled/logged out after a successful login.</li>
    </ul>
